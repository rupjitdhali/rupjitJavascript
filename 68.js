JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation - it's a lightweight format for storing and transferring data between a client and a server.

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) is the universal language of data interchange in modern computing. It's lightweight, human-readble, and machine-parsable. Every major programming language (Python, Java, Go, Rust, etc.) can parse and generate JSON easily.
